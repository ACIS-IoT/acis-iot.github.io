<font color= red>Modeling and Analysis of Tampering Attacks and Energy Consumption Effects on Edge Servers using Concurrent Stochastic Games: A Formal Methods Perspectiv</font>.
In <em> Journal Applied Intelligence, Springer </em>, 2023 (Submitted).

  
<br /><p align="justify"><u>Abstract</u>: <em> Modern Internet of Things (IoT) architectures rely on a diverse range of computational logic and communication protocols. However, the susceptibility to security threats in these systems can render them vulnerable. It is crucial to consider these threats at a high level of design, particularly focusing on the architecture's independence from specific communication protocols. This enables accurate prediction and assessment of system behavior. In our approach, we employ the Concurrent Stochastic Game model to precisely specify the behavior of IoT communication entities (referred to as players) while considering potential attacks at the communication edge. We interpret this model within PRISM language for automated analysis where the game goals modeling functional and security requirements are expressed using reward Probabilistic Alternating Temporal Logic (rPATL). To validate our approach, we examine representative threats based on Microsoft's STRIDE framework applied to dam water flow control under external connectivity attacks and study its relationships with energy consumption. The innovation brought by the article is the investigation of potential attacks through an automata-based model at the architectural level, deviating from traditional game equation models while still achieving the desired game goal.</em></p>
