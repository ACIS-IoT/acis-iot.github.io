abstract={This article presents theLTL-preserving stubborn set method for reducing the amount of work needed in the automatic verification of concurrent systems with respect to linear-time temporal logic specifications. The method facilitates the generation ofreduced state spaces such that the truth values of linear temporal logic formulas are the same in the ordinary and reduced state spaces. The only restrictions posed by the method are 1) the formulas must be known before the reduced state-space generation is commenced; 2) the use of the temporal operator ``next state'' is prohibited; and 3) the (reduced) state space of the system must be finite. The method cuts down the number of states by utilizing the fact that in concurrent systems the net result of the occurrence of two events is often independent of the order of occurrence.},

abstract="Checking that a given finite state program satisfies a linear temporal logic property is suffering in many cases from a severe space and time explosion. One way to cope with this is to reduce the state graph used for model checking. We define an equivalence relation between infinite sequences, based on infinite traces such that for each equivalence class, either all or none of the sequences satisfy the checked formula. We present an algorithm for constructing a state graph that contains at least one representative sequence for each equivalence class. This allows applying existing model checking algorithms to the reduced state graph rather than on the larger full state graph of the program. It also allows model checking under fairness assumptions, and exploits these assumptions to obtain smaller state graphs. A formula rewriting technique is presented to allow coarser equivalence relation among sequences, such that less representatives are needed.",

Refinement mappings (homomorphisms) have long been advertised as an important method for solving the language-inclusion problem in practice. When confronted with large verification problems, we therefore attempted to make use of both techniques. We soon found that rather than offering instant solutions, the success of assume-guarantee reasoning depends critically on the construction of suitable abstraction modules, and the success of refinement checking depends critically on the construction of suitable witness modules. Moreover, as abstractions need to be witnessed, and witnesses abstracted, the process must be iterated. We present here the main lessons we learned from our experiments, in limn of a systematic and structured discipline for the compositional verification of reactive modules. An infrastructure to support this discipline, and automate parts of the verification, has been implemented in the tool Mocha.",

This new technique avoids the space blow up of BDDs, generates counterexamples much faster, and sometimes speeds up the verification. In addition, it produces counterexamples of minimal length. We introduce a bounded model checking procedure for LTL which reduces model checking to propositional satisfiability.We show that bounded LTL model checking can be done without a tableau construction. We have implemented a model checker BMC, based on bounded model checking, and preliminary results are presented.",

The method is based on standard fixed point algorithms, combined with BDDs and SAT-solvers to perform satisfiability checking. As a result we are able to model check systems for which standard BDD-based methods fail. For example, we model check a liveness property of a 256 bit shift-and-add multiplier and we are able to find a previously undetected bug in the specification of a 16 bit multiplier. As opposed to Bounded Model Checking (BMC) our method is complete in practice.",

abstract={In practice, finite state concurrent systems often exhibit considerable symmetry. We investigate techniques for reducing the complexity of temporal logic model checking in the presence of symmetry. In particular, we show that symmetry can frequently be used to reduce the size of the state space that must be explored during model checking. In the past, symmetry has been exploited in computing the set of reachable states of a system when the transition relation is represented explicitly [14, 11, 19]. However, this research did not consider arbitrary temporal properties or the complications that arise when BDDs are used in such procedures.},

abstract = {Embedded system design is a complex process that demands an extensive system level modeling. Its implementation encompasses software and hardware components and its interconnections. In such systems, it is widely recognized that safety should be considered at the design stage itself, particularly at the architectural level to minimize the design effort. This paper presents a novel methodology based on model-driven specification and probabilistic model checking to automatically analyze safety based availability before synthesizing the embedded software product. Initially, the specification relies on the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) standard. Applying this standard, software components, communication links, and hardware platform are modeled. From the software components, a formal specification suitable for analysis and verification is extracted. When the verification is done and constraints satisfied, the software code is generated. We demonstrate how model specification and verification techniques can be successfully applied to safety and availability analysis of the train control system.}

Strategies to accelerate adoption of formal methods include making formal methods a part of the undergraduate software engineering curriculum, hosting courses in formal methods for working engineers, funding the integration of tools, funding improvements to tool interfaces, and promoting/requiring the use of formal methods on future contracts.",

abstract="Trusted Space Autonomy is challenging in that space systems are complex artifacts deployed in a high stakes environment with complicated operational settings. Thus far these challenges have been met using the full arsenal of tools: formal methods, informal methods, testing, runtime techniques, and operations processes. Using examples from previous deployments of autonomy (e.g. the Remote Agent Experiment on Deep Space One, Autonomous Sciencecraft on Earth Observing One, WATCH on MER, IPEX, AEGIS on MER, MSL, and M2020, and the M2020 Onboard planner), we discuss how each of these approaches have been used to enable successful deployment of autonomy. We next focus on relatively limited use of formal methods (both prior to deployment and runtime methods). From the needs perspective, formal methods may represent the best chance for reliable autonomy. Testing, informal methods, and operations accommodations do not scale well with increasing complexity of the autonomous system as the number of text cases explodes and human effort for informal methods becomes infeasible. However from the practice perspective, formal methods have been limited in their application due to: difficulty in eliciting formal specifications, challenges in representing complex constraints such as metric time and resources, and requiring significant expertise in formal methods to apply properly to complex, critical applications. We discuss some of these challenges as well as the opportunity to extend formal and informal methods into runtime validation systems.",

abstract={Over the last 20 years, runtime verification (RV) has grown into a diverse and active field, which has stimulated the development of numerous theoretical frameworks and practical tools. Many of the tools are at first sight very different and challenging to compare. Yet, there are similarities. In this work, we classify RV tools within a high-level taxonomy of concepts. We first present this taxonomy and discuss its different dimensions. Then, we survey the existing RV tools and, where possible with the support of tool authors, classify them according to the taxonomy. While the classification continually evolves, this article presents a snapshot with 60 state-of-the-art RV tools. We believe that this work is an important step in establishing a common terminology in RV and enabling a meaningful comparison of existing RV tools.},

abstract={Deriving an accurate behavior model from historical data of a black box for verification and feature forecasting is seen by industry as a challenging issue especially for a large featured dataset. This paper focuses on an alternative approach where stochastic automata can be learned from time-series observations captured from a set of deployed sensors. The main advantage offered by such techniques is that they enable analysis and forecasting from a formal model instead of traditional learning methods. We perform statistical model checking to analyze the learned automata by expressing temporal properties. For this purpose, we consider a critical water infrastructure that provides a scenario based on a set of input and output values of heterogeneous sensors to regulate the dam spill gates. The method derives a consistent approximate model with traces collected over thirty years. The experiments show that the model provides not only an approximation of the desired output of a feature value but, also, forecasts the ebb and flow of the sensed data.},
