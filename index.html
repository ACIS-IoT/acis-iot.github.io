<h1>ACIS-IoT: sAfety and seCurIty asSurrance for critical IoT systems</h1>

  
<p><u>Summary of CNRS ACIS-IoT project</u>u>: <em>A commonly observed trend in the IoT domain is the emergence of a plethora of cost-effective connected devices for specific domains. However, the advent of energy-efficient protocols for low-cost communication compromises the quality of service due to their potential exposure to security threats. Additionally, IoT applications tend to offer high scalability in terms of user feature requirements. In certain application domains, threats and errors may arise during system execution that were not considered during the modeling phase. Unexpected events and detected threats need to be coupled with original systems through refinement or composition to construct more sophisticated attack mitigation schemes. </em> </p>

<br /><u>Abstract</u>: <em> Modern cyber-physical systems rely on diverse computation logics and communication protocols, but their susceptibility to security threats poses significant vulnerabilities. To ensure resilience and mitigate these risks, it is crucial to consider system design at a high level, specifically focusing on the architecture to accurately predict system behavior. In this paper, we propose an approach that utilizes a component-based software architecture meta-model coupled with probabilistic automata for precise specification of component behavior and stateful connectors. By interpreting the resulting model in the PRISM language, we enable analysis of both functional and security requirements expressed using probabilistic computation tree logic. To validate our approach, we examine representative threats from Microsoft's STRIDE framework and showcase its effectiveness through a case study involving cranes orchestration via a drone system vulnerable to satellite attacks.</em> <br />
