<h1>ACIS-IoT: sAfety and seCurIty asSurrance for critical IoT systems</h1>

  
<p align="justify"><u>Summary</u>: <em>In the domain of the Internet of Things (IoT), we are witnessing a notable trend characterized by the proliferation of cost-effective connected devices tailored for specific domains. However, the adoption of energy-efficient protocols for low-cost communication introduces potential vulnerabilities that compromise the quality of service. Moreover, IoT applications must accommodate high scalability to meet diverse user feature requirements. Unfortunately, during system execution, unforeseen threats and errors may arise that were not accounted for during the modeling phase. In order to address these challenges, it becomes necessary to couple unexpected events and detected threats with original systems through refinement or composition techniques. This enables the construction of more sophisticated attack mitigation schemes that enhance both security and scalability in IoT applications.</em> </p>

<br /><u>Abstract</u>: <p align="justify"><em> Modern cyber-physical systems rely on diverse computation logics and communication protocols, but their susceptibility to security threats poses significant vulnerabilities. To ensure resilience and mitigate these risks, it is crucial to consider system design at a high level, specifically focusing on the architecture to accurately predict system behavior. In this paper, we propose an approach that utilizes a component-based software architecture meta-model coupled with probabilistic automata for precise specification of component behavior and stateful connectors. By interpreting the resulting model in the PRISM language, we enable analysis of both functional and security requirements expressed using probabilistic computation tree logic. To validate our approach, we examine representative threats from Microsoft's STRIDE framework and showcase its effectiveness through a case study involving cranes orchestration via a drone system vulnerable to satellite attacks.</em></p> <br />
