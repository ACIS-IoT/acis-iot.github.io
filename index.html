<h1>ACIS-IoT: sAfety and seCurIty asSurrance for critical IoT systems</h1>

  
<p>Summary of the project: A commonly observed trend in the IoT domain is the emergence of a plethora of cost-effective connected devices for specific domains. However, the advent of energy-efficient protocols for low-cost communication compromises the quality of service due to their potential exposure to security threats. Additionally, IoT applications tend to offer high scalability in terms of user feature requirements. In certain application domains, threats and errors may arise during system execution that were not considered during the modeling phase. Unexpected events and detected threats need to be coupled with original systems through refinement or composition to construct more sophisticated attack mitigation schemes.</p>
