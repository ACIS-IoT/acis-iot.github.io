<br /><p align="justify"><u>Abstract</u>: <em> Modern cyber-physical systems rely on diverse computation logics and communication protocols, but their susceptibility to security threats poses significant vulnerabilities. To ensure resilience and mitigate these risks, it is crucial to consider system design at a high level, specifically focusing on the architecture to accurately predict system behavior. In this paper, we propose an approach that utilizes a component-based software architecture meta-model coupled with probabilistic automata for precise specification of component behavior and stateful connectors. By interpreting the resulting model in the PRISM language, we enable analysis of both functional and security requirements expressed using probabilistic computation tree logic. To validate our approach, we examine representative threats from Microsoft's STRIDE framework and showcase its effectiveness through a case study involving cranes orchestration via a drone system vulnerable to satellite attacks.</em></p>
