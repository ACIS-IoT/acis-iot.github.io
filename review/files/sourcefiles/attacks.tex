In this section, we will delve into the process of learning attack frequencies from the input dataset. Considering that attacks occur within specific periods, as visualized in \fig{}. The Mean Time Between Attacks (MTBA) is learned from the dataset using existing algorithms from the literature, such as   Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm (L-BFGS-B) \cite{} and Nelder-Mead algorithm \cite{}.
